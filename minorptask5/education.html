    <p>Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, formerly known as Rajendra Agricultural University, is a
        public central agriculture university and is recognised as Institute of National Importance by government of
        India. It is located in Pusa, Samastipur district, Bihar</p>

        Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University (Earlier, Rajendra Agricultural University) was originally
        established as India's first-ever Imperial Agriculture Research Institute.

        The foundation stone of the Agricultural Research Institute and college was laid by Lord Curzon on 1 April 1905
        with the financial assistance of Henry Phipps, Jr., an American philanthropist. Phipps was a family friend of
        Lady Curzon, the daughter of an American millionaire, and the wife of Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India. In his
        speech, the viceroy had expressed his vision that the seed he was planting would soon blossom out, making Pusa
        the nucleus of agricultural activities, research and education which would not only benefit Bihar and Bengal but
        the whole of the country and would attract the best of talents from India and abroad. In separate meeting with
        the Bihar Planters Association, he fervently hoped that the institute would-be of immense service to them in
        their grave hour of crisis caused by the German Indigo scientist.

        Lord Curzon left by the end of 1905 and Lord Minto was his successor. Till the last minute, he had seen through
        each and every detail of the Pusa project which virtually was his brainchild. Incidentally, one major issue on
        which he had not agreed was the architecture of the main building, its wings, vaults, and arches but finally, he
        gave his consent of course with a stint. Rightfully, Pusa received an imperial status in 1918, being renamed as
        the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute (IARI).

        In 1934, after a major earthquake rocked Bihar and which severely damage the main buildings, the Imperial
        Institute was shifted to the new Pusa campus in New Delhi and that eventually became Indian Agricultural
        Research Institute. What remained was downgraded to an agricultural research station until 3 December 1970, when
        the government of Bihar established Rajendra Agricultural University.
