        MY FAVOURITE SPORT
    </h1>
    <p style="color:red">
        My favourite sports is football i love to play football it is a game played by two teams each consist 11 players
        who plays but after this there
        there are also some more plyers present in a football team .
        In a football team there must be 15 to 18 players.
    </p>
    <p style="color:green">
        There are some rules in football which re very important just like there is a time limit of 90 minutes in this
        90 minutes there are two halfs of 45 mins each.
