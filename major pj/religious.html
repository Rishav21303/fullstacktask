    <h2>BODH GAYA,BIHAR</h2>
    <p>The term 'Bihar' derives from the Sanskrit word 'Vihāra', which means abode and it itself explains the relation
        of Bihar with the viharas, used as the Buddhist abode. The land of Bihar is considered to be the richest one in
        context of Buddhism as it showered the divine light of enlightenment on a young ascetic, Siddhartha Gautama, in
        Bodh Gaya under Bodhi Tree. This makes Bodh Gaya is a holiest site in Buddhism and place of pilgrimage
        associated with the Mahabodhi Temple Complex in Gaya district in the Indian state of Bihar. The Gautama Buddha
        preached many sermons in different places of like Vaishali and Rajgir. Even after His Mahaprinirvana, disciples
        carried on the doctrine of Buddhism in the regions of Magadha, Bihar. Gautama Buddha's disciples opened several
        monasteries and Universities such as Nalanda University and Vikramshila University. Magadha emperor Ashoka the
        Great became a Buddhist and made Buddhism state religion and spread its doctrine, in different parts of India
        and abroad.</p>

    <h2>VISHNUPAD TEMPLE</h2>
    <p>As its name suggests, the majestic Vishnupad Temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Vishnu and houses a 40 cm
        long footprint of the Lord, which is sheltered by a silver plated basin. This footprint signifies the act of the
        Lord subduing Gayasur into the surface of the earth by placing his feet on his chest.

        Inside the Vishnu Temple, you can also find several other shrines, dedicated to Lord Phalgwisvara and Lord
        Narasimha. Built back in 1787, Vishnupad Temple is one of the most important places of worship for the Hindus in
        Gaya and one of the many famous places to visit in Bihar.</p>

    <p>- The Vishnupad Temple has a footprint of Lord Vishnu incised into a basalt block and known as Dharmasila.
        - The date of the original construction of the temple is not yet known. According to popular mythological
        beliefs Lord Rama had visited this place with Mata Sita.
        - The present shrine was remodelled in 1787 by the ruler of Indore, Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar.
        - For the construction of the temple, Ahilya Bai Holkar had sent her officers to fetch the best stone of the
        region and they returned with Munger Black Stone.
        - As there wasn’t any good road and the mountains were located far away from Gaya, the officers of Ahilya Bai
        Holkar found another mountain near the village of Bathani to carve and easily get the stones to Gaya.
        - Highly skilled craftsmen were brought from Rajasthan to build the Vishnupad Temple, keeping the footprint of
        Lord Vishnu in the centre.</p>
