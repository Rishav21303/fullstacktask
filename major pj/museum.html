    <h2>overview</h2>
    <p>In July 2011, the Bihar Government signed a Memorandum of understanding with Canada-based consultancy firm Lord
        Cultural Resources in July 2011[11] to appoint them as the museum planning consultants for the project. In
        January 2012, following an international architectural competition, Japan-based Maki & Associates and its Indian
        partner OPOLIS, Mumbai were appointed as the primary consultant architect for the project.[12][13] The completed
        museum is spread over 5.6 hectares, having 24,000 square meters of built area.[14]

        Lord Cultural Resources designed the exhibitions in the museum's nine permanent galleries.[15] Artefacts from
        ancient India to 1764 are on display in Bihar Museum's permanent gallery, while those of the post-1764 period
        are on display at the older Patna Museum.[16] The 2300 year old Didarganj Yakshi is among the highlight exhibits
        in the Bihar Museum.[17]

        In October 2017, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi visited Bihar Museum with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish
        Kumar.[18]</p>

    <h2>exhibits</h2>
    <p>The Bihar Museum has several galleries. These include the Orientation gallery, the children gallery, the regional
        gallery, the contemporary gallery, the historical art galleries, the Bihari Diaspora gallery and the visible
        storage gallery. The exhibits on different subjects are displayed in separate galleries. Each gallery is huge
        and has many artifacts on display including ones dating back to the fourth century.[20]</p>
    <p>The gallery gives an overview of the Museum and a theatre is located at the end of the gallery.[21] A brief film
        introducing the museum and its collections is screened in the auditorium regularly. Film shows on Bihar's
        timeline and Bihar's history are also shown</p>
    <p>Its collection of artefacts and exhibit items is divided into six domains: the Orientation Room, the Wildlife
        Sanctuary, the history sections on Chandragupta Maurya and Sher Shah Suri, the Arts and Culture section and the
        Discovery Room. Among the exhibits are a simulated the Asian paradise flycatcher, the Indian giant flying
        squirrel, animals, birds, trees and plants native to the state of Bihar. The gallery's focus is family learning;
        most exhibits are designed to be interactive, allowing children and families to actively participate.[</p>
