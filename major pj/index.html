    <h1 align="center">TOURISM IN BIHAR</h1>
    <p>Bihar is a state in eastern India. It is the third largest state by population, the 12th largest by area, and the
        14th largest by GDP in 2021.[9][10][11] Bihar borders Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the
        northern part of West Bengal to the east, and with Jharkhand to the south. The Bihar plain is split by the river
        Ganges, which flows from west to east.[12]

        On 15 November 2000, southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand.[13] Only 20% of the population
        of Bihar lives in urban areas as of 2021.[14] Additionally, almost 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25,
        giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state.[15] The official language is Hindi and
        additional language is Urdu, although other languages are common, including Maithili, Magahi, Bhojpuri, and
        other Languages of Bihar.

        In Ancient and Classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered the centre of political and cultural
        power and as a haven of learning.[16] From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one
        of the world's most widely adhered-to religions: Buddhism.[17] Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and
        Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule.[18] Another region of Bihar, Mithila,
        was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.[19][20]</p>
